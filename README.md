# RocketAir-Inspired Website

## Overview
This is a front-end project inspired by **[RocketAir](https://rocketair.com/)**, built to experiment with smooth animations, scrolling effects, and modern UI elements. The website focuses heavily on **GSAP animations** for engaging transitions. It is **not fully responsive**, and some image quality issues exist.

## Features
- Multi-page layout with a sleek UI
- Heavy use of **GSAP & ScrollTrigger** for animations
- Interactive hover effects and dynamic scrolling elements
- Custom cursor animation for an enhanced experience
- Fixed navigation with smooth disappearing effects
- **Not fully responsive**

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** - Structured page layouts
- **CSS** - Styling, animations, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** - Interactivity and event handling
- **GSAP & ScrollTrigger** - Advanced animations and smooth scrolling effects
- **Rellax.js** - Parallax scrolling effects
